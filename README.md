# Lendsqr Frontend Engineer Test

I made an admin dashboard containing informations of its users, total number of users, total active users, users with loans and users with savings. The application was made using create react app.

## Technologies used

The Frontend framework used was react.

### Typescript

Typescript is a superset of javascript, It enables developers to add type safety to their projects thereby reducing the likelihood of bugs in a codebase.

### SCSS

The styling was made with scss which is basically css with superpowers. scss helps you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a program construct, It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker, It also provides nesting so you can use nested syntax.

The unit testing was made with cypress and was used in order to push out a bug free product
